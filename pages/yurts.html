            <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
            <dd>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome
              that can be opened, and a private deck
            </dd>
            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>
              Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king sized bed with
              down-quilt, comfy couch, dining table with chairs, mini fridge,
              microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience
              includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
              restroom facilities are located in the lodge
            </dd>
            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>
              Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
              changing weather with light layers of clothing. It is also helpful
              to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
